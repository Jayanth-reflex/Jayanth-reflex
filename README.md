# Hi there! Iâ€™m Kolli Gnana Jayanth Reddy

**Coding enthusiast, automation ninja, and part-time bug whisperer**

With 3 years in the trenches of software engineering, I specialize in turning complex problems into clean, scalable solutions. Whether itâ€™s optimizing automation frameworks, developing new features, designing robust processes, securing data flows, or leading Agile teams, Iâ€™m your go-to for making software run smoother and faster.

I thrive on collaboration â€” because great software isnâ€™t built alone; itâ€™s built over countless cups of coffee and creative brainstorming sessions. When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me debugging lifeâ€™s mysteries or mountaineering.
